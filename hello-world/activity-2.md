index file:
First 10 lines of code are defining the styling elements of the page
div tag is showing that the demo is defined an html file
script tag is importing he javascript file and Lit
line 18 declares the title as a constant
render tag defines what output is shown on the browser, in this case it is the hello world title
query selector - not entirely sure but think it has something to do with searching an identified style through an id

The `your-element.js` is the file that is defining the hello-world, while the file in the src file is the actual code for the page and grabs
from the definition in the js file. The src file is a place for you to edit the html and the js file allows you to use the same code/style on other pages as well

Lit is important because it simplifies programming by providing a library of sources for us to use. In this case, it is providing a css style for us to use
